                        My name is Clopedia, I've started to learn coding for a year. Before, I didn't have any idea on how to write a piece of code, I used a piece of software without understanding the functionality and the component that used to build it.

                        I started to learn coding this year. For starting we learned about all the tools that are useful for coding, the quick example is a computer. The thing we learnt first is HTML without any style. We learnt most of the elements, tags and how to use them to write a piece of text. Later on, we started to add style which is css to make the piece of text have a nice look. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog__">
                        Half way of the year, we started to learn Javascript which is the big thing and tool that makes your websites and applications nice. It is a very big deal though. We had some online courses that helped us to understand what's going on and how to use some new things in front-end. Now we are learning react, which is really nice but tough as well.
